<p>Chapter I</p>

<p>TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE  CIRCUMSTANCES
ATTENDING HIS BIRTH</p>

<p>Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many  reasons it
will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to  which I will assign no
fictitious name, there is one anciently  common to most towns, great or
small: to wit, a workhouse; and  in this workhouse was born; on a day and
date which I need not  trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of
no possible  consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at
all  events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head  of
this chapter.</p>

<p>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow  and
trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of  considerable doubt
whether the child would survive to bear any  name at all; in which case it
is somewhat more than probable that  these memoirs would never have
appeared; or, if they had, that  being comprised within a couple of pages,
they would have  possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise
and  faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any  age
or country.</p>

<p>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a  workhouse,
is in itself the most fortunate and enviable  circumstance that can
possibly befall a human being, I do mean to  say that in this particular
instance, it was the best thing for  Oliver Twist that could by possibility
have occurred. The fact  is, that there was considerable difficulty in
inducing Oliver to  take upon himself the office of respiration,–a
troublesome  practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our
easy  existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock 
mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the  next: the
balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now,  if, during this
brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by  careful grandmothers, anxious
aunts, experienced nurses, and  doctors of profound wisdom, he would most
inevitably and  indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody
by,  however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by  an
unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such  matters by
contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point  between them. The result
was, that, after a few struggles,  Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded
to advertise to the  inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden
having been  imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could 
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been 
possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much  longer space
of time than three minutes and a quarter.</p>

<p>As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of  his
lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over  the iron
bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was  raised feebly from
the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly  articulated the words, &#39;Let
me see the child, and die.&#39;</p>

<p>The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the  fire: giving
the palms of his hands a warm and a rub  alternately. As the young woman
spoke, he rose, and advancing to  the bed&#39;s head, said, with more
kindness than might have been  expected of him:</p>

<p>&#39;Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Lor bless her dear heart, no!&#39; interposed the nurse, hastily 
depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of  which she
had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#39;Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have,  sir,
and had thirteen children of her own, and all on &#39;em dead  except two,
and them in the wurkus with me, she&#39;ll know better  than to take on in
that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it  is to be a mother,
there&#39;s a dear young lamb do.&#39;</p>

<p>Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother&#39;s prospects  failed
in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head,  and stretched out
her hand towards the child.</p>

<p>The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold  white lips
passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over  her face; gazed wildly
round; shuddered; fell back–and died.  They chafed her breast, hands, and
temples; but the blood had  stopped forever. They talked of hope and
comfort. They had been  strangers too long.</p>

<p>&#39;It&#39;s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!&#39; said the surgeon at last.</p>

<p>&#39;Ah, poor dear, so it is!&#39; said the nurse, picking up the cork of 
the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she  stooped to
take up the child. &#39;Poor dear!&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;You needn&#39;t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,&#39;
said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 
&#39;It&#39;s very likely it WILL be troublesome. Give it a little gruel 
if it is.&#39; He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on  his way
to the door, added, &#39;She was a good-looking girl, too;  where did she
come from?&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;She was brought here last night,&#39; replied the old woman, &#39;by
the  overseer&#39;s order. She was found lying in the street. She had 
walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but  where she
came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.&#39;</p>

<p>The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. &#39;The  old
story,&#39; he said, shaking his head: &#39;no wedding-ring, I see.  Ah!
Good-night!&#39;</p>

<p>The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse,  having once
more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on  a low chair before
the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.</p>

<p>What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver  Twist was!
Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his  only covering, he
might have been the child of a nobleman or a  beggar; it would have been
hard for the haughtiest stranger to  have assigned him his proper station
in society. But now that he  was enveloped in the old calico robes which
had grown yellow in  the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell
into his  place at once–a parish child–the orphan of a workhouse–the 
humble, half-starved drudge–to be cuffed and buffeted through  the
world–despised by all, and pitied by none.</p>

<p>Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an  orphan, left
to the tender mercies of church-wardens and  overseers, perhaps he would
have cried the louder. &#39;</p>
