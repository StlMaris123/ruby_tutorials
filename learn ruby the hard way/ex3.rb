#mathematics
#use of interpolation is how we insert Ruby computations
#displays the following code
puts "i will now count my hens"
#executes the computations and interpolates it wit Hens and also Roosters
puts "Hens #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "Roosters #{100-25*3%4}"

#displays the following code
puts "I will now count my eggs"
#Executes the following computation using PEMDA and displays the answer
puts 3+2+1-5+4%2-1/4%6

#displays the following code
puts "is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7"
#compares the value of 3+2 and 5-7 and returns a boolean value
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#Executes the code inside the parenthesis and concatenates it with the string
puts "what is 3 + 2? #{3+2}"
puts "what is 5 - 7? #{5-7}"

#Displays the following thhe code
puts "oh thats why its false"
puts "How about some more?"

#executes the code inside the parenthesis and concatenates the boolean value value to the string
puts "is it greater? #{5 > -2}"
puts "is it greater or equal? #{5 >= -2}"
